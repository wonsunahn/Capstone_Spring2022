## Your responsibilities

You must fulfill all of these responsibilities to get a satisfactory grade:

1. Attend each class synchronously.  See [Attendance](#attendance).

1. Give a presentation on your work.  See [Presentation organization](#presentation-organization).

1. Write a final paper.  See [Final paper organization](#final-paper-organization).

1. Fill out peer reviews for each presentation on TopHat.  See [Peer review organization](#peer-review-organization)

1. (CS 1950 students only) send regular progress reports.  See [Progress report organization](#progress-report-organization).

Failure to fulfill any of the above responsibilities may result in a "Not
Complete" grade or a penalty on your letter grade.

## Attendance

* TopHat attendance will be taken for each class.

* Per university policy, online attendance via Zoom will be permitted only for
  the duration of 8/27 ~ 9/10.  There will be Zoom links posted for subsequent
classes, but the link are to be used only by students with extenuating
circumstances who got prior permission.

* **NOTE:** You may miss **2 classes** in the entire semester without providing
  a reason.  Additional missed classes must be due to an extenuating
circumstance supported by documentation (such as a medical or family
emergency).

## Presentation organization

* <s>We will conduct a Doodle Poll on presentation dates in class on our second class (1/21).  The below link will go live on that date (first-come-first-serve)</s>

* The Doodle Poll is over.  Here is the finalized [Presentation Schedule]({{site.baseurl}}/internship_presentation_schedule).

* Each student is expected to present for **15 minutes**, with 5 minute Q&A
  and 5 minute peer review.  There will be a folder in TopHat for each
presenter, and under it, slides for the presentation, along with the peer
review questions.  

* Please review the [Lecture on Presentations](/lectures/lecture-on-presentations-internship.pdf) and the [Lecture on
  Assertion Evidence Format](/lectures/lecture-on-assertion-evidence-format.pdf) before giving your presentation.  

* Presenters must submit their presentation slides to the "Presentation Slides"
  assignment on Canvas the day before, by **Thursday midnight**.  The slides
will be uploaded to TopHat so that they can be reviewed by your classmates.
The preferred format is PDF or Powerpoint.  

* Recordings of presenters are uploaded to Canvas Panopto within an hour of the
  talk.  Watching a recording of your own talk can be an enlightening
experience (you can trust me on this).

* **NOTE:** If your presentation is not satisfactory, you will be asked to
  present once more with your instructor one-on-one outside of class hours.
This will be your final chance to give a satisfactory presentation.

## Final paper organization

* Write a 8 - 12 page paper on your internship experience.  For details, see the
[Final Paper Instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/final_paper).  PDF format is
preferred.  The paper should be submitted to Canvas by midnight of **April 22**.
Please consider submitting the paper earlier to get feedback.

* **NOTE:** If you submit your final paper at least one week before the
  deadline, you will be provided feedback and given a chance to resubmit if
your paper is not satisfactory.  Otherwise, your paper will be considered
as-is.

## Peer review organization

* For each presenter, there will be a folder in TopHat containing the slides
  for the presentation and a few peer review questions.  The TopHat questions
should be submitted to TopHat by **Friday midnight** on the day of the
presentation.

* Please review [tips for writing a good review]({{site.baseurl}}/review_tips).
  Be specific about what you liked and disliked.

* The peer reviews are anonymized when posted to TopHat and are immediately
  viewable by the presenter.  Note that the peer reviews **will not impact the
presenter's grade**.  You can give honest feedback and scores without feeling
guilty about lowering your friend's grade.  The instructor will make the final
determination on the quality of the presentation.

## Progress report organization

This section is only for CS 1950 students.

* Please send regular progress reports to both your instructor (me) and
  research advisor by email, before each weekly or bi-weekly meeting.  

* The report allows your research advisor to get a summary update of your
  progress before starting each meeting.  It also allows your instructor to
monitor your progress and spot communication problems before they become a
major issue.  

* The progress reports are meant to help you, not burden you.  The main
  consumer of the report is your research advisor, so you can use whatever
format conveys the information best to your advisor.

* Your advisor will "Approve" your report if your progress is satisfactory ---
  otherwise feedback will be given.
