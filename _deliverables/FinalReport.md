## FINAL PAPER

This final paper is required for all students in the Capstone, including internship (CS 1900) and research (CS 1950) students.

## FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

The paper must be 8 - 12 pages in length, double-spaced, using a relatively standard font and point size (e.g., 12-point Times New Roman or Computer Modern).  Judicious use of charts, graphs, and/or illustrations is acceptable.  Margins should be of standard size.

Please ensure that your name as well as the name of the project you worked on is listed, along with your faculty advisor (whoever signed your Faculty Learning Agreement, or your research advisor).

## DETAILS

The final paper should describe what you did for the capstone, and how you did it.  This will obviously vary dramatically based on if you did a research project or an internship.  Thus, it is difficult to give a broad-enough description of what is required for all of these.  Consider the following as a list of possible topics to discuss, not as a checklist.

1. What programming language did you use?  Why?
2. Were there things about the choice of language you liked?  Disliked?
3. What frameworks did you use?
4. How did you handle clarifying requirements?
5. What technical problems did you face?
6. How did you ensure quality code?
7. What kind of testing did you do?
8. What was the development process like?
9. How did you communicate with other developers/testers/customers/etc?
10. Did you have non-technical problems that you had to face?
11. What were the biggest challenges you faced during the capstone?
12. Were you able to take what you learned during the capstone and apply it to classes?  Conversely, were you able to use what you learned in class for the capstone project?
13. How did you design the software you were writing?
14. Did you present the project to customers?  How did you plan for it?
15. What was day-to-day life like?
16. Did you have a mentor?  What did they teach you?
17. What was the worst part of the capstone project?
18. How did you deal with ambiguity in requirements or direction?
19. Did you learn any interesting skills during the capstone project?

In general, what I would like to see is a good understanding of what you did, and what you learned, doing the work for the capstone.  If you worked on anything sensitive (e.g., for a government contractor or private data for a company), you do not need to refer to it in your write-up.  If there is any doubt, you may wish to show your supervisor the paper so that they may review it before turning it in.

## Paper Organization

I have provided example organizations for either internships or research apprenticeships.  Please feel free to use your own organization.  Regardless of what organization you use, I am going to ask you to have sections / subsections and corresponding section headers.  Each section should focus on the topic described in the section header.  A section should comprise of one or more paragraphs that are also well-focused.

### Example organization for CS 1900 students

1. Introduction
    * Talk about the company itself and what types of products it makes.
    * Talk about the placement of your team in the organization.
    * Talk about how the rest of the paper is going to be organized.
    
3. Objectives / Motivation
    * Talk about the business need for the work that you were doing.
    * Talk about the final outcome that you were shooting for.
  
1. Implementation
    * Talk about the actual work you did.  If you worked on multiple projects, you will likely have subsections.
    * Talk about the programming languages, frameworks, or tools that you used to achieve your goal.
    * Talk about technical / organizational challlenges you faced and how you resolved them.
    * Optionally talk about the non-technical side of your work, such as communicating with clients, if you feel that was important.
    * Consider inserting figures or flow charts that describe your implementation.
    
1. Outcome
    * Talk about the final outcome of your project(s).
    * Describe what business impact your work had.
    * Explain goals that you were not able to achieve because of technical or organizational difficulties.

1. Issues and reflections
    * Reflect on what you learned for the internship.  Were you able to fulfill all your learning goals?
    * Importantly, describe any issues in your organization that prevented you from reaching those goals (e.g. supervisor did not mentor you, there were organizational barriers, or employer changed goals when you got there).
